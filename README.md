# practice_interview_questions
A repository containing my solutions to practice interview questions

Each folder in the root contains problems tried during the respective month and year. In each of these folders,
there will be a solved folder containing problems I have a solution to. These may or may not be the optimal solutions,
but they are my best effort for the given time. There will also be an unreviewed folder. These are problems I have not looked into detail. Next, there will be a todo folder. This folder contains problems I have not solved, but want to do next. Finally, there will be an other folder containing snippits and other information. 

Thanks for viewing!
