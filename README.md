# practice_interview_questions
A repository containing my solutions to practice interview questions

Each folder in the root contains problems tried during the respective month and year. In each of these folders,
there will be a solved folder containing problems I have a solution to. These may or may not be the optimal solutions,
but they are my best effort for the given time. The files outside these solved folders I have either not attempted
or have not solved yet.

Thanks for viewing!
